While this system is quite usable, its automation is still very basic, mostly because while playtesting I prefer the VTT experience to be as close as possible to the face-to-face one.</p><p>At the moment, most things on sheets are rollable: Resistances, skills, talents, gear and wealth. There is a button on character, menace and master sheets to refesh all pools which takes into account any bonuses from Gear or Special Features. Bonuses given by gear or talents are mostly handled correctly. Finally, the combat encounters panel allows updating how many actions each actor is taking through buttons on the combatant.</p><p>What isn't in place yet is any automation for conflicts; you have to adjudicate the rolls and apply damage manually.</p>",

This is usually text from one of the <em>A Light in Dark Places</em> books. It has no system effect, it is just text.</p><p><b>Dice:</b> Items that represent Abilities (ie. skills and schools of magic) have a number of Dice attached. This is how many dice to roll when rolling the item.</p><p><b>Bonus:</b> The bonus field, found on gear, talents and special features <em>does</em> have a game effect. It can be one of three forms. The simplest is The name of a Pool followed by a modifier (eg. Health +1). This is a simple bonus to a pool, used when resetting the pool to its maximum value. The second is the name of an Ability followed by +1d (eg. Fight +1d). This gives a bonus to all rolls of the named skill. The final form is an Ability name followed by +1do (eg. Notice +1do). This is an optional bonus; it is only added to the Ability when the specific item with the bonus is rolled.</p>",
