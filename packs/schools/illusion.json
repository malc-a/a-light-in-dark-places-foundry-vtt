    "description": "<p>This subtle school of magic is concerned with manipulating the senses to deceive the unwary. It allows the manipulation of the senses, including sight, sound, smell and touch. The core of this School is, of course, illusions. An illusion can't affect the real world in any way - it can't move a real object, or damage a character; although an advanced enough illusion can make a character <em>feel</em> the pain of a blow, that pain isn't real. Illusions can distract characters or conceal real things. An illusion that affects the sense of touch will <em>feel</em> correct when lightly touched, but has no substance. You could create an illusion of a door, but people would still be able to walk through it freely.</p>\n<p>Spells of this School are cast with firm gestures, as well as spoken incantations.</p>\n<h2>Spontaneous Casting Complexities</h2>\n<table style=\"width: 100%; height: 85px;\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 12.6633%;\"><col style=\"width: 87.3367%;\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\"><td style=\"height: 17px;\"><strong>Complexity</strong></td><td style=\"height: 17px;\"><strong>Effect</strong></td></tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\"><td style=\"height: 17px;\">0</td><td style=\"height: 17px;\"><p>Create an illusion affecting one sense</p></td></tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\"><td style=\"height: 17px;\">1</td><td style=\"height: 17px;\"><p>Create an illusion affecting three senses; Inflict Focus damage through images</p></td></tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\"><td style=\"height: 17px;\">2</td><td style=\"height: 17px;\"><p>Create an illusion affecting all senses; use senses at a distance</p></td></tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\"><td style=\"height: 17px;\">3</td><td style=\"height: 17px;\"><p>Remove all traces of an object to one sense</p></td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",
