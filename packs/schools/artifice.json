It has very few related spells, and most of those spells are unique in that castings vary in Complexity. A character can learn such a spell at any Complexity, and may then cast it at at any Complexity up to the highest they have learned.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Casting most spells from this School requires not only the usual spoken works and gestures, but also access to a wizard's laboratory to prepare the item which is to be enchanted. Binding a spell into an item for a single use will require only a minor laboratory, but more lasting enchantments will require the caster to access to a major wizard's laboratory while they work.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Spontaneous Casting Complexities</span></h2>\n<table style=\"width: 100%; height: 85px;\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 12.6633%;\"><col style=\"width: 87.3367%;\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px;\"><strong>Complexity</strong></td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px;\"><strong>Effect</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px;\">0</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Determine whether an item is enchanted, and if so from which School</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Determine the exact properties of an enchanted item</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Determine how an item could be destroyed or disenchanted</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",
