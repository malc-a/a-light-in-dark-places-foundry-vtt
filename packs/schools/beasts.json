Creatures created by magic fall into a grey area; if they have existed outside of their original creation for a long enough time, reproducing in a natural way, then they may count as natural creatures.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As well as animals themselves, this School also covers animal products such as meat, fur, leather, horn or wool. For the purposes of this School, the term animal includes insects, reptiles, birds and fish. Casting spells from this School usually requires firm gestures as well as incantations.</span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Spontaneous Casting Complexities</span></h2>\n<table style=\"width: 100%; height: 85px;\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 12.6633%;\"><col style=\"width: 87.3367%;\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px;\"><strong>Complexity</strong></td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px;\"><strong>Effect</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px;\">0</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Gain information on an animal or its emotions</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Calm an animal; shape an animal product</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Speak to animals; summon or control a single animal</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"height: 17px;\">3</td>\n<td style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Boost an animal's Resistances and Abilities</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Take the form of an animal or change an animal's form</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",
