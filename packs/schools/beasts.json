    "description": "<p>This School concerns itself with 'natural' creatures, loosely defined as those which have the level of intelligence one would expect of an animal, and no magical abilities. Creatures created by magic fall into a grey area; if they have existed outside of their original creation for a long enough time, reproducing in a natural way, then they may count as natural creatures.</p>\n<p>As well as animals themselves, this School also covers animal products such as meat, fur, leather, horn or wool. For the purposes of this School, the term animal includes insects, reptiles, birds and fish. Casting spells from this School usually requires firm gestures as well as incantations.</p>\n<h2>Spontaneous Casting Complexities</h2>\n<table style=\"width: 100%; height: 85px;\" border=\"1\"><colgroup><col style=\"width: 12.6633%;\"><col style=\"width: 87.3367%;\"></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\"><td style=\"height: 17px;\"><strong>Complexity</strong></td><td style=\"height: 17px;\"><strong>Effect</strong></td></tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\"><td style=\"height: 17px;\">0</td><td style=\"height: 17px;\"><p>Gain information on an animal or its emotions</p></td></tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\"><td style=\"height: 17px;\">1</td><td style=\"height: 17px;\"><p>Calm an animal; shape an animal product</p></td></tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\"><td style=\"height: 17px;\">2</td><td style=\"height: 17px;\"><p>Speak to animals; summon or control a single animal</p></td></tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\"><td style=\"height: 17px;\">3</td><td style=\"height: 17px;\"><p>Boost an animal's Resistances and Abilities</p></td></tr>\n<tr><td>4</td><td><p>Take the form of an animal or change an animal's form</p></td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",
