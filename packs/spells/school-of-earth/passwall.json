The length of the passageway depends on the successes in the margin: 1 success gives close range, 2-3 short range and 4 or more medium range. The passageway is wide and tall enough for a person to pass through. If anyone is in the passageway when the spell ends they are safely ejected at the nearest end.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
