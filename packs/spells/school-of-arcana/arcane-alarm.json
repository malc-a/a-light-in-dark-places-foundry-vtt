These lines serve as an alarm; if any are broken by something passing through them, then the caster will receive a mental alert that this has happened, and where. The alert is enough to wake the caster if they are sleeping. Creatures within the area of the alarm when the spell is cast will not trigger alerts when they break the lines of magic.</p>",
