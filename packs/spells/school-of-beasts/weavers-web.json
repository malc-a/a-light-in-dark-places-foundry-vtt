The web may be held upright if there is something that could anchor it in that position. Creatures within the web are likely to become stuck; Make a Body roll for the character to oppose the margin of the spell. If the Body roll fails then treat the character as grappled, unable to move and taking a penalty equal to the margin by which they failed the Body roll to all actions. To break free, the stuck character must make an Athletics roll opposed by the spell&rsquo;s margin.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
