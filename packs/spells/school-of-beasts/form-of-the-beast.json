The number of successes in the margin dictate what the shape might be; 1 success gives a small dog, a cat or a hawk, 2 successes a wolf or large dog, 3 a lion, tiger or bear. If the margin is 4 or greater then any natural animal can be chosen.</p>\n<p>While shapechanged the caster will be unable to cast spells. They do get the benefit of the natural attacks, movement and senses of the chosen form, and should get a +1d or +2d bonus on anything the animal form would be expected to do better than their normal form. Other than this, the caster retains their own Resistances, Abilities and intelligence.</p>",
