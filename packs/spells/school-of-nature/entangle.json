Creeping roots or plants in an area within close range of the grow to huge size, and seize hold of any creatures within close range of the target area. Entangled creatures may make a Body roll to oppose the margin of the spell. If the Body roll fails then treat the character as grappled, unable to move and taking a penalty equal to the margin by which they failed the Body roll to all actions. To break free, the stuck character must make an Athletics roll opposed by the spell's margin.</p>",
