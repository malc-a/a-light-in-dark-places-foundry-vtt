It may be a flat plane which spans two points up to short range apart, or a circle at the boundaries of close range. Arrows and bolts will be blocked by the plants. Any creature trying to force a way through the thorns will take +6 Health damage, which may be resisted by a Body roll. If the creature is damaged by the thorns then it fails to pass through the wall. </span>The <em>Pass Plant</em> spell works normally on a <em>Wall of Thorns</em>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
