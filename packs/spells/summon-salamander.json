There must be a large enough fire in the area to allow the salamander to manifest; usually this requires a fire that is larger than a camp fire. While the spell lasts the salamander will follow the caster's commands; once the spell ends the salamander dissipates back into the largest fire available.</p>\n<p>Your GM will have details of salamanders. Each success in the margin will add one dice to one of the salamander's Resistances or Abilities.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
