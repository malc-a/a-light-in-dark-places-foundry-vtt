If it fails, then they must follow the command given to the best of their ability. They do not have to follow the command exclusively, but must try to fulfil it within the time limit. If the target either acts in a manner contrary to the command, or allows the time limit to expire without attempting to fulfil the command then they take +6 Focus damage from the spell, which may <em>not</em> be resisted.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
