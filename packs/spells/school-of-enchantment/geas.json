    "description": "<p>Allows the caster to issue a command to the target creature, forcing it into service while the spell lasts. The creature must be able to understand the command for the spell to work, and self-harming or suicidal commands will fail. Commands must be able to be fulfilled before the next full moon, when the spell will end.</p>\n<p>The target may make a Mind roll to resist the spell. If it fails, then they must follow the command given to the best of their ability. They do not have to follow the command exclusively, but must try to fulfil it within the time limit. If the target either acts in a manner contrary to the command, or allows the time limit to expire without attempting to fulfil the command then they take +6 Focus damage from the spell, which may <em>not</em> be resisted.</p>",
