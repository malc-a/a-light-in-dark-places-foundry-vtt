The caster may get a bonus to their casting roll if the target is in a situation where falling asleep is reasonable. The target may make a Difficulty 1 Notice roll to wake up whenever there are loud noises (such as combat) nearby. The target can also be woken up by shaking or other normal means.</p>",
