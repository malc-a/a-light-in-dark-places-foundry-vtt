The confused character is no longer clearly aware of who their friends and enemies are, and will no longer make actions if involved in a conflict. If some action, like attacking the target, clearly demonstrates who is who then the target will defend themself as usual, and the confusion will end. During a conflict a confused creature may attempt to break free of the Confusion spell each round that the spell is sustained.</p>",
