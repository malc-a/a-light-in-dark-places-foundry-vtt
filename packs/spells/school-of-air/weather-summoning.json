Each step may increase or decrease the temperature, from freezing to cold, cold to warm, warm to hot or hot to stifling. A step may change the precipitation, from storm to rain, rain to drizzle or drizzle to dry. Finally, wind can be affected, from still to a breeze, a breeze to windy, a wind to strong winds, or a strong wind to a gale. If the temperature is cold, the caster can change rain to hail. If the temperature is freezing then rain will become sleet or snow.</span></p>\n<p>The weather is changed within sight range of the caster. Once changed, the weather will slowly revert to the naturally prevailing conditions, usually taking several hours to do so.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
