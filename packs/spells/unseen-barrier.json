It can be a flat plane which spans two points up to short range apart and up to close range high, or a sphere at the boundaries of close range. If flat, the barrier can be placed in any orientation, so it could be used to bridge a gap. Nothing, either physical or magical, can pass through the barrier in either direction.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
