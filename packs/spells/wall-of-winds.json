The wall can be a flat plane which spans two points up to short range apart, or a circle at the boundary of close range. Ranged attacks are impossible through the wall. If a creature tries to move through the Wall of Winds the caster rolls the sustained margin of the spell, opposed by a Body roll from the creature trying to penetrate the wall. If the caster wins, the creature is unable to move past the winds. Flying creatures make this Body roll at a -2d penalty.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
