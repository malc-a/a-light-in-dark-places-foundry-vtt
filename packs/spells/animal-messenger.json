The caster speaks the message and target to the animal, and gives the name and rough location of the target. The animal (a small bird is traditional) will then travel to the target, which must be somewhere that the animal can reach, and then passes the message to them. How long the message takes to be delivered will depend on how far away the target is, how fast the animal can travel and the margin of success.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
