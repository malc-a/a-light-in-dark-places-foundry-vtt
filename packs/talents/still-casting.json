You do not take any penalties for a lack of ability to gesture when using this School. If you also have the Silent Casting Talent for the same School of magic, then a Difficulty 2 Notice roll is required for a character to realise you are casting a spell. This Talent can be taken multiple times for different Schools of Magic.</p>"
