Bucklers<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>are effective in melee defense, and can also be used as weapons. Unlike larger shields they are too small to act as cover against a ranged attack. If a character using a buckler is injured in a fight, they can choose to sacrifice their buckler instead - the buckler is destroyed until repaired, and can no longer be used, but the character does not take any Injury from the attack, even if it would have caused multiple Injuries.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
