    "description": "<p>Similar to a crossbow, but with a steel prod, heavy crossbows are too powerful to draw manually, but use a crank called a cranequin to draw back the string. Because of this, the heavy crossbow is not only slow, but also requires a full round to be reloaded after firing. Reloading the crossbow is a free action, but it does limit the firing rate of a heavy crossbow to every other round.</p>",
