All of them are based on a long haft, typically around 1.5, to 2m in length. Among the most common are the halberd, which mounts an axe head and tops the haft with a spike; the partisan, similar to a spear with protrusions at either side of the base of the spear head, or the Lucerne hammer, which mounts a hammer head and a spike at the end of the haft.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
