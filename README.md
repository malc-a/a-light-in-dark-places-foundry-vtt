# A Light in Dark Places System

![Foundry v11](https://img.shields.io/badge/foundry-v11-green)

This system supports A Light in Dark Places, a rules-light system for running fantasy adventures in a broad range of settings.

At the moment the system is very much a work in progress. Most of the core functionality is in place, but there is almost no automation (it's pretty much just a character sheet and dice roller). This is because I'm using the VTT to playtest the game rules, and want an experience as close as possible to playing face-to-face. Once the game has been fully playtested, then more automation will be added.

While the VTT is quite usable at this stage, there are a number of things that need to be improved. Some of them depend on finishing the game itself (the VTT system is being written in parallel to the text of the game); others are deficiencies in the VTT which need to be corrected.

* It's not possible to set Gear costs to '-' (meaning don't even roll)
* It's not currently possible to change an NPC to another type (eg menace -> master)
* The special features and common NPCs from the GMs book should be added to the compendiums

There will be more added to this list as more of the game gets written.
