This system supports Those Who Wander, a rules-light system for running Fantasy adventures in a broad range of settings.

At the moment the system is very much a work in progress. Most of the core functionality is in place, but there is almost no automation (it's pretty much just a character sheet and dice roller), and the user interface is still in development; it's usable but not as attractive as it could be.
